              I've been programming since the beginning of 2020. What started as a 
              curiosity quickly grew into a passion as I discovered the joy of building 
              things with code.

            <p className="text-lg mb-6">
              When I'm not writing code, you might find me creating YouTube content about 
              programming or playing gamesâ€”sometimes analyzing how they're built.

              I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow 
              as a developer. I love the problem-solving aspect of programming and the 
              satisfaction of creating something useful.
